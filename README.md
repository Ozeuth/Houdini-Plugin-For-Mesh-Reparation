# Implementation of 3D reparation and hole-filling for meshes in Houdini

An artist-centered tool for the repair of high resolution meshes. Currently an extension of the research papers,

and [Filling Holes in 3D Meshes using Image Restoration Algorithms](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242075854_Filling_Holes_in_3D_Meshes_using_Image_Restoration_Algorithms).
These are combined with a Houdini Digital Asset, making a user-friendly, integrated plugin for Mesh Reparation.

## Description
This tool lets you repair 3D meshes with holes in them. Such holes are filled with coherent, context-aware new patches that are correct in both topology and microsurface detail.
